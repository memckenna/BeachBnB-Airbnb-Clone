# BeachBnB-Airbnb-Clone

In the BeachBnb clone you will connect an a backend application to use thunk
actions.

# Express-Sequelize Backend

This file documents the API routes made available by running this server.

## Setup

To start, you'll need to install our backend dependencies. If you're in the root
of this project, you'll need to move (`cd`) into the backend directory, before
running `npm install`.

Then, you'll need to create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file
that's available in this directory. Be sure to create a password for your
database user.

Using `psql` in the terminal, create a user with a password and `createdb` that
matches the one described in the `.env` file. We'll be using `dotenv` with
`sequelize` to pass our environment variables declared in the `.env` to our
`sequelize` commands.

After quitting out of the `psql` instance, you can run the following commands to
finish database setup.

* `npm run db:setup`

This command will run the following three in order:

* `npx dotenv sequelize db:create`
* `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`
* `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`

Because we specified that the port for the backend should be `5000`, we will
need to set up the `proxy` key in our frontend `package.json` so that our
frontend can pass any `/api` calls to the backend server.

Place the following at the bottom of your `frontend/package.json` file.

```json
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```
